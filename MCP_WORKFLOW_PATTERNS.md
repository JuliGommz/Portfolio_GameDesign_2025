```

### **Pattern 3: Rapid Prototyping**
```
User Story: "I need to quickly prototype a landing page"

Workflow:
1. Magic MCP â†’ Generate hero, features, and CTA sections
2. Context7 MCP â†’ Ensure modern framework usage
3. Puppeteer MCP â†’ Generate screenshots for stakeholder review
4. Memory-Bank MCP â†’ Track prototype decisions
5. GitHub MCP â†’ Create feature branch for prototype

Command Sequence:
"Generate landing page with hero, features, testimonials, CTA"
"Ensure components use React 19 and Next.js 15 patterns"
"Generate desktop and mobile screenshots"
"Log prototype architecture decisions"
"Create prototype branch and commit initial version"
```

### **Pattern 4: Quality Assurance Pipeline**
```
User Story: "I need comprehensive testing before deployment"

Workflow:
1. Playwright MCP â†’ Cross-browser testing
2. Puppeteer MCP â†’ Visual regression testing
3. GitHub MCP â†’ Automated CI/CD pipeline
4. Memory-Bank MCP â†’ Document test results
5. Context7 MCP â†’ Validate against current standards

Command Sequence:
"Run comprehensive cross-browser tests"
"Generate visual regression report"
"Execute automated deployment pipeline"
"Document test coverage and results"
"Validate code against current best practices"
```

## ðŸ”„ INTEGRATION PATTERNS

### **Parallel Processing Pattern**
```
Simultaneous Tasks:
- Context7 MCP: Research latest patterns
- Figma MCP: Extract design specifications  
- Magic MCP: Prepare component templates
- Playwright MCP: Setup test environment

Benefit: 70% faster development cycle
Use Case: Complex feature development
```

### **Sequential Optimization Pattern**
```
Step-by-Step Refinement:
1. Magic MCP â†’ Initial component generation
2. Tailwind Designer MCP â†’ Style optimization
3. Context7 MCP â†’ Pattern validation
4. Playwright MCP â†’ Quality validation
5. Memory-Bank MCP â†’ Decision documentation

Benefit: Highest quality output
Use Case: Production-ready components
```

### **Feedback Loop Pattern**
```
Iterative Improvement:
1. Generate â†’ Test â†’ Refine â†’ Document
2. Each MCP provides feedback to previous step
3. Continuous improvement until quality threshold met

Benefit: Self-optimizing workflow
Use Case: Complex problem solving
```

## ðŸš€ ADVANCED PATTERNS

### **Design System Automation**
```typescript
// Pattern: Automated design system updates
interface DesignSystemPattern {
  trigger: "Figma design update" | "Component library change";
  mcpSequence: [
    "figma" â†’ "extract updated specifications",
    "tailwind-designer" â†’ "optimize CSS variables", 
    "magic" â†’ "regenerate affected components",
    "playwright" â†’ "validate design consistency",
    "github" â†’ "commit design system update"
  ];
  output: "Updated design system with validation";
}
```

### **Performance Optimization Pattern**
```typescript
// Pattern: Automated performance optimization
interface PerformancePattern {
  trigger: "Performance threshold exceeded";
  mcpSequence: [
    "context7" â†’ "research performance best practices",
    "magic" â†’ "optimize component implementations",
    "playwright" â†’ "run performance audits",
    "memory-bank" â†’ "document optimization decisions",
    "github" â†’ "deploy optimized version"
  ];
  metrics: "Bundle size, Core Web Vitals, Accessibility";
}
```

### **Content Generation Pattern**
```typescript
// Pattern: Dynamic content creation
interface ContentPattern {
  trigger: "Content update needed";
  mcpSequence: [
    "magic" â†’ "generate placeholder content",
    "context7" â†’ "validate content structure",
    "puppeteer" â†’ "screenshot content layouts",
    "memory-bank" â†’ "track content decisions",
    "github" â†’ "version content updates"
  ];
  output: "SEO-optimized, accessible content";
}
```
