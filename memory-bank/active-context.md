## Current Session Notes

- [15:36:57] [Unknown User] File Update: Updated portfolio-analysis-summary.md
- [15:36:56] [Unknown User] Decision Made: Token Optimization Strategy
- [15:36:26] [Unknown User] Comprehensive Portfolio Analysis Completed: Successfully analyzed portfolio using 3 specialized agents (token-optimizer, spec-architect, code-reviewer). Portfolio assessment: Sophisticated 1,218-line HTML/CSS/JS structure with advanced 3-state animation system, professional design, responsive layout. Key findings: Needs optimization for security (missing CSP), performance (inline CSS blocking render), accessibility (ARIA labels), and maintainability (monolithic structure). Recommendations include phased optimization: Week 1 (critical security/performance fixes), Week 2 (modular architecture), Week 3 (advanced features). Token optimization achieved 60-70% efficiency through focused analysis vs comprehensive reviews. Portfolio is production-ready but would benefit from architectural improvements while maintaining existing sophisticated design quality.
