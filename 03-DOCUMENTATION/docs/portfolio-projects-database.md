*Last Updated: 2025-01-15*

## Project 01: mind.set.play (2019)
**Subtitle**: Corporate Culture Transformation Game
**Year**: 2019
**Duration**: 6 months (with 1 student assistant)
**Team**: Solo Design Leadership + 1 assistant
**Partnership**: VORSPRUNGatwork & Schirmmacher Group

### The Challenge
How can clients not only understand but directly experience the transformative power of VORSPRUNGatwork's approach to corporate culture and New Work? The challenge: to design a simulation game that makes it tangible how personal work attitudes, goal orientation, and adaptability influence team processes and overall business success — and how these factors play out under VUCA conditions (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity).

### Goals
**Project Goals (given)**
- Design and deliver a 4–6 hour, board-game-like simulation ("Monopoly for transformation") for 6–18 participants
- Make the effect of personal work attitudes, goal orientation, and adaptability tangible under VUCA conditions
- Translate New Work & culture principles into experiential learning with immediate feedback
- Provide a facilitation-ready format developed over 6 months (with one student assistant) and deployed via Schirmmacher Group

**My Goals (gamification & method)**
- Prove that role switching + flexible attitude presets + event triggers + goal orientation lower the entry barrier and activate energy
- Make the learning loop explicit and measurable (visible change in team dynamics and efficiency post-play)
- Ensure guided debriefs convert play into actionable workplace tactics
- Document design choices for transferability across client contexts

### Core Innovation
Creation of a hybrid gamification concept featuring:
- **Role-Switching Mechanics**: Participants switch between hierarchy levels (responsibility ranges) and predefined attitude presets (e.g., enthusiastic, skeptical, passive, solution-oriented) — broad examples; customizable to context
- **Goal Orientation System**: Teams must complete client orders under time pressure and shifting market conditions
- **Event Triggers**: Randomized events (successes, conflicts, market changes) simulate real VUCA dynamics
- **Learning Loop**: Immediate feedback on player decisions reveals direct impact on team performance, collaboration, and client outcomes

### Learning Engine
Players directly experience how changes in attitude, role, and external conditions impact individual performance, collaboration, and overall team processes — and how these factors interact under VUCA conditions.

### Program Format (per session)
- **Runtime**: 4–6 hours
- **Participants**: 6–18

### Impact & Results
- **Measurable Change**: Notable improvements in team dynamics and efficiency after gameplay
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Abstract transformation principles translated into practical, lived experience
- **Corporate Impact**: Framework adaptable to real workplace situations
- **Client Success**: Strengthened VORSPRUNGatwork's ability to demonstrate their methodology's effectiveness

### Skills Demonstrated
Solo project leadership • Gamification design • Corporate stakeholder management • Behavioral psychology application • Small team coordination • Business process analysis

### Gamification Approach – In Retrospect
- **Game Mechanics as a Mirror of Reality**: Role switching, adaptable attitude presets, and event-driven challenges convert abstract transformation topics into first-hand experiences
- **Energy Activation**: The board-game-like format ("Monopoly for transformation") invites active participation and lowers the barrier to complex New Work topics
- **Experiential Insight**: Play and fun trigger "aha moments" about collaboration, conflict resolution, adaptability, and external change
- **Real-World Transfer**: Guided post-game discussions connect in-game insights to actionable workplace strategies

**Tech**: C# minigame development

### The Challenge
Develop a solo C# minigame in six weeks, including an inventory system, item collection, pause functionality, and at least one scene transition — despite initial limited coding experience. The project required translating conceptual ideas into a functional, playable game while learning new technical skills and documenting the process.

### Goals
**Project Goals (given)**
- Build a solo C# mini-game in 6 weeks with an inventory system, item collection, a pause function, and at least one scene transition
- Implement a 2D side-scroller (left/right + jump), two 30-second levels, an intro screen, and sound
- Produce a GDD and clear documentation

**My Goals (gamified problem-solving)**
- Turn my limited coding knowledge into a structured, gamified challenge: progress via targeted tutorials → working base → AI-assisted enhancements
- Use narrative-first design to control scope and reduce cognitive load

- Optimize for steady, visible wins to sustain motivation and build confidence

### Core Innovation
Creation of a pragmatic, learning-first development workflow combining:
- **Narrative-Driven Design**: Story-first approach: a magic-charged dungeon with falling items and a hungry chest, providing context and guiding technical implementation
- **Minimal Viable Mechanics**: 2D side-scroller with left/right movement and jump, two 30-second levels, intro screen, sound, pause button, inventory and item pickup
- **Learning & Iteration**: Selected tutorials and references that matched personal learning style; built a foundation system, then iteratively enhanced functionality using AI-assisted coding
- **Transparent Documentation**: All design and development steps recorded, clearly noting which work was self-authored, tutorial-based, or AI-assisted
- **Problem-Solving Approach**: Focused on achievable goals and small wins to maintain motivation and progress, using a playful, game-like mindset as a cognitive scaffold

### Learning Engine
- Experience in bridging conceptual ideas and technical implementation under realistic time constraints
