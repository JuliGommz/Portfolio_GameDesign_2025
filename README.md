## 🚀 QUICK START GUIDE

### For Julian (ADHD-Optimized Workflow):

1. **ALWAYS START HERE:** Open `01-MAIN-WORKSPACE/START-HERE.html` in browser
2. **Primary Work:** Use `portfolio-main.html` for quick edits (everything in one file)
3. **Organized Work:** Use `portfolio-modular.html` when working on larger features
4. **Single Focus Rule:** Edit only ONE file at a time
5. **Test Immediately:** Every file can be opened directly in browser

### Keyboard Shortcuts in START-HERE.html:
- Press `1` = Open main working file
- Press `2` = Open modular version

## 🎯 FILE PURPOSES

### 01-MAIN-WORKSPACE (Active Development)
- **portfolio-main.html** = Self-contained complete portfolio (PRIMARY)
- **portfolio-modular.html** = Clean HTML structure with external dependencies
- **styles.css** = All CSS styling for modular version
- **app.js** = Core JavaScript functionality
- **animation-system.js** = Background animations and effects
- **ui-components.js** = Reusable interface components

### 02-ARCHIVE (Reference Only)
- Test files and backups
- Keep for reference but don't edit
- Safe to ignore during active development

### 03-DOCUMENTATION (Context & Specs)
- Project specifications and documentation
- MCP memory bank for AI collaboration
- Read for context, rarely edited

### 04-ASSETS (Media Files)
- Images, fonts, and other resources
- Supporting files for portfolio content

## 🧠 ADHD WORKFLOW PRINCIPLES

### ✅ DO:
- Start with `START-HERE.html` every session
- Focus on ONE file at a time
- Use `portfolio-main.html` for quick changes
- Test changes immediately in browser
- Save frequently (Ctrl+S becomes muscle memory)

### ❌ DON'T:
- Edit multiple files simultaneously
- Work directly in src/ folder (archived)
- Skip the START-HERE navigation
- Delete files from 02-ARCHIVE (backup safety)

## 🔄 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

1. **Session Start:** Open `01-MAIN-WORKSPACE/START-HERE.html`
2. **Choose Mode:**
   - Quick edit = `portfolio-main.html`
   - Feature work = `portfolio-modular.html` + external files
3. **Edit & Test:** Make changes, test in browser immediately
4. **Save & Backup:** Frequent saves, archived originals preserved
