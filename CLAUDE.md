# Portfolio Project - Gamification & Narrative Design
**Auto-Context**: Julian (43, ADHD, trilingual) | Internship-focused | Strategic positioning

## Project Identity
**Role Target**: Gamification Strategist & Narrative Designer
**Core Value**: Unconventional problem-solving → engaging solutions  
**Strategic Positioning**: "What if we approached this completely differently" strategist

**Focus Areas**: Corporate transformation, Educational design, Social impact, Behavioral change

## Portfolio-Optimized Rule Framework [AUTO-ACTIVE]

### V-Rule (Portfolio): Verify → Validate → Visual
**MANDATORY for portfolio changes**:
1. **Verify**: Code + animation states (neutral/stars/trails) + responsive
2. **Validate**: UX flows + accessibility + performance  
3. **Visual**: Design consistency + mobile + animation smoothness
**Triggers**: Animation system, content updates, responsive changes

### Double-Loop (Strategic): Analysis → Implementation → Review → Refinement  
**With strategic narrative alignment at each step**
**Integration**: Each loop reinforces "unconventional problem-solver" positioning

### Think (Career-Focused): Strategic portfolio reasoning
- Career alignment | Narrative consistency | Technical demonstration
- Hiring manager experience | Evidence building for capabilities

## Technical Architecture

### Quick Access
```bash
cd C:\J.Gomez\Projects-Repository\School\Portfolio
# Open src/index.html - pure HTML/CSS/JS (no build required)
```

### Critical Systems ⚠️ [DON'T MODIFY WITHOUT V-RULE]

#### Animation Toggle System (Lines 1051-1100)
**States**: `neutral` (default) | `body.enable-stars` (50% brighter) | `body.enable-trails` (Superman trails 0s,2s,4s,6s)
**Critical**: Atomic state management - never modify toggle logic

#### Project Card System
**Layout**: CSS Grid (asymmetrical) | **Hover**: Custom cursor + blur removal | **Modal**: Click → detail overlay

#### Project Structure
```
Portfolio/src/index.html (1,218 lines) + docs/ + assets/ + CLAUDE.md
```

### Adding New Portfolio Projects [V-RULE REQUIRED]

1. **Project Card HTML** (Lines ~862-929): Standard card structure
2. **Modal Content** (Lines ~1114-1178): Update `projects` object  
3. **Positioning**: `project-top-left`, `project-top-right`, `project-middle-left`, `project-bottom-right`, `project-bottom-center`

### Strategic Evidence (Hiring Managers)
**Projects**: mind.set.play (leadership transformation), Gourmet Invader (process innovation), This Website (AI collaboration)
**Technical**: 3-state animation system, responsive design, custom UX components

## Development Workflow [RULE-INTEGRATED]

### Standard Process: Think → Double-Loop → V-Rule
1. **Think**: Strategic reasoning + career alignment analysis
2. **Double-Loop**: Analysis → Implementation → Review → Refinement  
3. **V-Rule**: Verify → Validate → Visual before completion

### Critical Changes ⚠️ [FULL RULE FRAMEWORK REQUIRED]
**High-Risk**: Animation system, responsive layout, modal system, strategic messaging
**Requirements**: All 3 animation states tested, mobile responsive verified, narrative consistency maintained

## Deployment & Status
**Repository**: https://github.com/JuliGommz/Portfolio_GameDesign_2025 | **Status**: Production ready

## Development Gotchas [CRITICAL SYSTEM KNOWLEDGE]
1. **Animation Toggle**: Fragile system - test all 3 states (V-Rule required)
2. **Mobile Hover**: 1.8x card scaling - z-index conflict risk (Incremental_Boundary)  
3. **Grid Positioning**: Asymmetrical layout breaks easily (Baseline_Recovery required)
4. **Modal Z-Index**: Fixed at 1000 (Context_Before_Code for modifications)

## Strategic Development Roadmap [RULE FRAMEWORK INTEGRATED]

### Phase 1: Immediate Impact
- [ ] Project demos + accessibility + performance + strategic content (Full rule framework)

### Phase 2: Technical Demonstration  
- [ ] Modular architecture + build pipeline + error handling + advanced interactions (Rule framework)

### Phase 3: Portfolio Optimization
- [ ] Analytics + A/B testing + monitoring + case studies (Strategic rule integration)

### High ROI Wins
- [ ] Outcome docs + challenge stories + collaboration evidence + innovation examples
